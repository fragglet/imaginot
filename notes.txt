Two files:
	For these, the c: gets replaced according to -d parameter.

	COMM_FILE  "c:sopwith?.dta" /*  Multi user communications file  */
		- ? gets replaced with 0-9 based on game number chosen
	COMM_CMD   "c:semaphor\0   "/*  Multi-user semaphor file        */

Startup procedure:
	multopen:
		bopen("c:")
		name_to_sec:
			make_bpb:
				bseek to 0
				bread 512 bytes (1 block)
				fill bpb struct from block
			get_ent:
				lookup:
					reads a series of blocks, starting from
					location defined by bpb. each is
					interpreted as a dirent. we look for a
					file with name matching target.
					populates a dirent when found
			clu_to_sec:
				dirent.dc contained cluster; we map this to
				a sector, taking bpb fields into account
			sectparm:
				call int 21h fn 44h subfn 04h (read)
				check for signature 0x4003
				calculate multaddr, multdriv, multhead

		comm{driv,head,trk,sect,asect} get calculated for command
		(semaphore) file while mult* versions for communication file

		- repeat of multopen bopen() for COMM_FILE drive
			calculate multaddr, multdriv, multhead, multdriv

		_dkioset
			setting up interrupts
		try 25 times to multread:
			bseek to semaphore sector, bread
			check first byte == 0xfe
			bseek to semaphore sector, bwrite
			set first byte to 0xff
			bseek to semaphore sector, bread
			check first byte == 0xff now
			bseek to comms sector, bread into multbuff
			

			


During gameplay:

	swmove() calls multput()
	 - does both read and write, stop and go synchronized between players
	
	multput -> _multput:
		updated(0, player):
			Blocks until players 0...player-1 ready
			"ready" means in FINISHED state
			we repeatedly call _dkio() to read from disk
				calls int 13h function 2

		now we're ready to write our ticcmd
		swgetc() to read ticcmd
		written to mu->mu_key[player]
		mu->mu_lstplyr is set to player

		_dkio() writes buffer containing ticcmd
			calls int 13h function 3

		updated(player + 1, mu->mu_maxplyr)
			- blocks until all other players have also written


dkio internals:
	basically an implementation of coroutines where a background process
	is started that can be paused to block until an amount of time has
	passed or an interrupt has been received

	_dkproc:
		starts a background coroutine; switches stack and then invokes
		the function passed as an argument.
		dkiosts is changed to DKINPROC while the coroutine is active
		and then changes back to DKIDLE when complete
	_dktick:
		suspends the current coroutine until a timer has expired
		tickcount saves the number of ticks to wait
		dkiosts is changed to DKTICK until timer expires
		switches back to normal stack and returns thru eg. _dkproc
		(or whatever was happening when the last interrupt suspended
		the normal process)
	_dktckint:
		ISR invoked by timer interrupt
		decrements tickcount
		once it reaches zero, _dkresume is invoked
	_dkresume:
		called internally by other _dkio code
		switches stacks and restarts coroutine
	_dkwait:
		called internally by interrupt code
		sets dkiosts to DKWAIT to block until an interrupt is rxed
		switches back to normal stack, returns to whatever the
		normal code was doing
	_dkioset (setup):
		sets int 0Eh (IRQ6 = disk controller) to _dkhrdint
		sets int 13h (BIOS API) to _dksftint
		sets int 1Ch (system timer tick) to _dktckint
	_dksftint:
		13h BIOS interrupt wrapper
		1. busy loop if interrupt rxed, if currenly waiting
		2. in case of DKINPROC (coroutine active), we invoke special
		   code. all swmultio _dkio calls happen inside coroutine
		3. special code (labels bg2, bg3, bg4) handle BIOS 13h
		   interrupt calls for read, write, verify, format, status
		4. rdwrvr handles read/write (the one we care about most)
		5. normal code path: rdwrvr -> rwv1 -> rwv2 -> nsp1
		6. waitwrun uses _dkwait to wait to block until interrupt
		7. _dkhrdint calls _dkresume to contine 13h call. motor now on
		8. sk4 -> return to caller

=== Ox patching

From swinit.c:

    initoxen()
    {
    register OBJECTS *ob;
    register int      i;
    static   iox[] = { 1376, 1608 };
    static   ioy[] = { 80,   91   };

Translates to:

    0x60, 0x05, 0x48, 0x06, 0x50, 0x00, 0x5b, 0x00,

In SOPWITH2.EXE:

0000a620  ff fe ff ff ff fe ff ff  ff fe ff 60 05 48 06 50  |...........`.H.P|
0000a630  00 5b 00 01 00 02 00 02  00 03 00 03 00 02 00 02  |.[..............|

X:
  1376 -> 1080 (flat ground left of cyan base)      38 04
  1608 -> 1970 (flat ground right of magenta base)  b2 07
Y:
  80 -> 42 (ground @26 + 16)                        2a 00
  91 -> 42 (ground @26 + 16)                        2a 00

=== Fix repeated-crash bug

swmove.c crashpln:

        ob->ob_hitcount = ( ( abs( obo->ob_x - ob->ob_x ) < SAFERESET )
                         && ( abs( obo->ob_y - ob->ob_y ) < SAFERESET ) )
                         ? ( MAXCRCOUNT << 1 ) : MAXCRCOUNT;

it looks like this fixes the same bug and the original just looked like:

        ob->ob_hitcount = MAXCRCOUNT;  // =10

       0000:222c 8b 76 fe        MOV        SI,word ptr [BP + local_4]

                      ^^ change to 0x10
