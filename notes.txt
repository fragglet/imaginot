Two files:
	For these, the c: gets replaced according to -d parameter.

	COMM_FILE  "c:sopwith?.dta" /*  Multi user communications file  */
		- ? gets replaced with 0-9 based on game number chosen
	COMM_CMD   "c:semaphor\0   "/*  Multi-user semaphor file        */

Startup procedure:
	multopen:
		bopen("c:")
		name_to_sec:
			make_bpb:
				bseek to 0
				bread 512 bytes (1 block)
				fill bpb struct from block
			get_ent:
				lookup:
					reads a series of blocks, starting from
					location defined by bpb. each is
					interpreted as a dirent. we look for a
					file with name matching target.
					populates a dirent when found
			clu_to_sec:
				dirent.dc contained cluster; we map this to
				a sector, taking bpb fields into account
			sectparm:
				call int 21h fn 44h subfn 04h (read)
				check for signature 0x4003
				calculate multaddr, multdriv, multhead

		comm{driv,head,trk,sect,asect} get calculated for command
		(semaphore) file while mult* versions for communication file

		- repeat of multopen bopen() for COMM_FILE drive
			calculate multaddr, multdriv, multhead, multdriv

		_dkioset
			setting up interrupts
		try 25 times to multread:
			bseek to semaphore sector, bread
			check first byte == 0xfe
			bseek to semaphore sector, bwrite
			set first byte to 0xff
			bseek to semaphore sector, bread
			check first byte == 0xff now
			bseek to comms sector, bread into multbuff
			

			


During gameplay:

	swmove() calls multput()
	 - does both read and write, stop and go synchronized between players
	
	multput -> _multput:
		updated(0, player):
			Blocks until players 0...player-1 ready
			"ready" means in FINISHED state
			we repeatedly call _dkio() to read from disk
				calls int 13h function 2

		now we're ready to write our ticcmd
		swgetc() to read ticcmd
		written to mu->mu_key[player]
		mu->mu_lstplyr is set to player

		_dkio() writes buffer containing ticcmd
			calls int 13h function 3

		updated(player + 1, mu->mu_maxplyr)
			- blocks until all other players have also written


dkio internals:
	_dkioset (setup):
		sets int 0Eh (IRQ6 = disk controller) to _dkhrdint
		sets int 13h (BIOS API) to _dksftint
		sets int 1Ch (system timer tick) to _dktckint
